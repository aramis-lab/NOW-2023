	- Around 96% will bring a laptop to the workshop

	- Around 45% never used git

	- 92% never used a data versioning tool before

## TODO for next meeting

- Matthieu: finish the HC volume extraction and clean the output TSV file.

- Nicolas + Matthieu: Update Part 2 Chapter 1 with new TSV input file. Verify that the simple model isn't too simple with real data...

- Nicolas: Add general content on DVC at begining of part 2 ==> no slide, make a jupyter-book to ease following.

- Ghislain: Add introduction materials on the utility and purpose of versioning code and data. Should last around 15 minutes.

- Camille: Add content on part 1 on code versioning. Requires to select part of the materials from the SED tutorial and convert them to Jupyter-book.

- All: Find a couple people interested to attend our training session next Tuesday.
