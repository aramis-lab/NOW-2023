- Matthieu
- Ghislain
- Nicolas


## Dicsussion

- List of participants will be available at the end of the week

- Because of internet issues, it might be difficult to have all participants following the workshop on Colab

- Might be better to have participants with compatible setups follow on their machines while participants with problematic setups follow on Colab 

- Git should be available on Colab and DVC should be pip installable as well

- We should wait to see what is the average Git level among the participants to prepare the first part of the workshop

- In the mean time, we should concentrate on preparing the second part on code + data versioning

- Exercice for the second part : Predict whether subjects have AD or not

	- From simple TSV data (HC volumes already extracted)

		- Model could be very very basic

		- The idea is that versioning operations on the TSV data would be clearly visible

		- Version the TSV data with Git or directly with DVC ??

	- From imaging data

		- Use only the left HC first and update the dataset afterwards to get the right HC as well

		- Use the already segmented and cropped HC images from the D4ML dataset

		- Version the models weights with the code and data to have reproducible experiments


## TODO for next meeting

- Matthieu + Camille : Prepare a list of questions for understanding the prior knowledge of participants (Git, DVC..) as well as their setup (personnal machine, OS, usage of command line...)

- Matthieu + Camille : Look at how to prepare an online form for polling the participants (Google Doc...)

- Ghislain : Take a look at introductory slides that could be used

- Ninon : Get the Git tutorial slides from the ICM

- Nicolas : Finish the infrastructure for the repository (automatic deployment of the jupyter-book to the aramis webserver is still missing)

- All : Read and execute the D4ML notebooks, download the dataset and take a closer look, check whether model training time is reasonable on personal laptops (CPU + RAM)

- All : Think about how we could extract HC volumes from the available images

- Nicolas ?? : Refactor model code as a black box model
