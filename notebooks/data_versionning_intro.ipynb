    "\n",
    "[DVC](https://dvc.org) is a tool for data science that takes advantage of existing software engineering toolset. It helps machine learning teams manage large datasets, make projects reproducible, and collaborate better.\n",
    "\n",
    "[DVC](https://dvc.org) does not replace or include Git. You must have git in your system to enable important features such as data versioning and quick experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[DVC](https://dvc.org) is written in Python and can be esily installed on the most common OS (Linux, MacOS, and Windows). We will see how to install [DVC](https://dvc.org) in the next chapter.\n",

    "\n",
    "- track and save data and machine learning models the same way they capture code\n",
    "- create and switch between versions of data and ML models easily\n",
    "- understand how datasets and ML artifacts were built in the first place\n",
    "- compare model metrics among experiments\n",
    "- adopt engineering tools and best practices in data science projects\n",
