    "## What is data versioning ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Versioning is a technique to **track changes made to data over time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves creating and storing **different versions of data**, allowing users to access and analyze specific versions whenever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Versioning ensures data consistency, traceability, and provides a **historical record of changes** made to datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traceability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Track and understand the changes made to the data over time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial for compliance, auditing, and debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "By preserving previous versions of data, Data Versioning enables **reproducibility of results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can analyze specific versions of the data used in previous analyses, ensuring consistency and accuracy of research and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Versioning facilitates collaboration among data analysts and data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple users can work on the same dataset simultaneously**, knowing they can easily access and switch between different versions without affecting others' work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of data corruption or accidental changes, Data Versioning provides a **backup of previous versions**, allowing users to recover and restore data to a specific point in time."

    "## What are the tools ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the area of code versioning, there are a few tools available but [Git](https://git-scm.com) clearly dominates the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to data versioning, a relatively younger field, there are still a **lot of available tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't focus on enumerating them all here, but we will name the most popular ones and give some pointers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lower-level tools\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.com) and [Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com) are two well-known data versioning tools. We consider them as \"low-level\" here in comparison to [DVC](https://dvc.org) and [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) which offer more complex abstractions built on top of other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "They may very well suit your needs depending on the kind of projects you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on **machine learning experiments** for which we believe that higher-level tools are better suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git-LFS\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://blog.lazy-evaluation.net/images/git-lfs-icon.png\" alt=\"git-lfs logo\">\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.com) replaces large files with text pointers inside [Git](https://git-scm.com), while storing the file contents on a remote server.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://git-annex.branchable.com/logo.svg\" alt=\"git-annex logo\">\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com) allows managing large files with [Git](https://git-scm.com), without storing the file contents in [Git](https://git-scm.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a lower-level tool than [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) and [DVC](https://dvc.org) which expose higher level abstractions to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-level tools\n",
    "\n",
    "[DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) and [DVC](https://dvc.org) are the two main players in the science data versioning world. [DVC](https://dvc.org)'s main audience is machine learning specialists and data scientists while [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) 's main target is researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datalad\n",

    "<img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8927200?s=280&v=4\" alt=\"datalad logo\">\n",
    "\n",
    "[DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) depends on [Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see it as a Python frontend to [Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com). It provides a lot of useful abstractions to version datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [DataLad handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/) is a great resource to learn how to use this tool.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why DVC ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will rely on [DVC](https://dvc.org) rather than on another tool from the list above. There are several reasons we made this choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [DVC](https://dvc.org) is free and open source.\n",
    "- [DVC](https://dvc.org) is very easy to install: it is written in Python and can be easily installed in various ways (pip, brew, conda...).\n",
    "- [DVC](https://dvc.org) is the data versioning tool we use in our daily work at Aramis.\n",
    "- The documentation is very good and easy to follow for newcommers.\n",
    "- The commands are **very** similar to the git commands. This means that anybody used to work with git will be able to work with DVC in no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These last points are particularly useful to enbark new contributors in a project relying on [DVC](https://dvc.org) for data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "[DVC](https://dvc.org) does not replace or include [Git](https://git-scm.com). You must have [Git](https://git-scm.com) in your system to enable important features such as data versioning and quick experimentation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is both a pro and a con. For this tutorial, we believe this is a strong plus. Indeed, we think that learning to make the difference between what is versioned with Git and what is versioned with [DVC](https://dvc.org) is a key point that would ve very valuable even when using DataLad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the target users of DVC ?\n",
    "\n",
    "[DVC](https://dvc.org) targets people who needs to store and process data files or datasets to produce other data or machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, anyone willing to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- track and save data and machine learning models the **same way they capture code**\n",
    "- create and switch between versions of data and ML models easily\n",
    "- understand how datasets and ML artifacts were built in the first place\n",
    "- compare model metrics among experiments\n",
    "- adopt engineering tools and best practices in data science projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try the other tools\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, you might be better using another tool. There are some dicussions ([here](https://discuss.dvc.org/t/comparison-to-datalad-and-git-annex/92) for example) trying to compare these tools. There is also a very interesting comparison between DVC and Datalad in the [DataLad handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/beyond_basics/101-168-dvc.html#dvc).\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly encourage you to make your own opinion by taking a closer look at them yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are interested in a low-level data versioning tool and not too afraid by an old-looking documentation, you might be better off with [Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com)\n",
    "- If you are more interested in easily discovering datasets published by others, you might want to try [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, let's focus on using [DVC](https://dvc.org) !"

    "The need for a versioning tool can often be seen through the proliferation of suffixes in the file / folder names. These suffixes usually convey information about:\n",

    "- author identity\n",
    "- specific milestones (a publication, a conference / workshop...)\n",

    "- the project becomes a mess very fast as people forget what the different names actually meant\n",
    "- the project total weight quickly explodes as everything is copy-pasted\n",
    "- there is no history / lineage, only snapshots in total disorder\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, it is **VERY** difficult to reproduce an experiment. You would have to remember what combination of data, code, model, and set of parameters gave a particular result. For large and long-lasting projects this is almost impossible to do without a proper versioning tool."

    "Data Version Control lets you capture the versions of your data and models in [Git](https://git-scm.com) commits, while storing them on-premises or in cloud storage. It also provides a mechanism to switch between these different data contents. The result is a single history for data, code, and ML models that you can navigate.\n",

    "- **Lightweight:** [DVC](https://dvc.org) is a free, open-source command line tool that doesn't require databases, servers, or any other special services.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Projects stay readable with stable file names — they don't need to change because they represent variable data. No need for complicated paths like `data/20190922/labels_v7_final` or for constantly editing these in source code.\n",
    "- **Efficient data management:** Use a familiar and cost-effective storage solution for your data and models (e.g. SFTP, S3, HDFS, etc.) — free from [Git](https://git-scm.com) hosting constraints. [DVC](https://dvc.org) optimizes storing and transferring large files.\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** Easily distribute your project development and share its data internally and remotely, or reuse it in other places.\n",
    "- **Data compliance:** Review data modification attempts as [Git](https://git-scm.com) pull requests. Audit the project's immutable history to learn when datasets or models were approved, and why.\n",
    "- **GitOps:** Connect your data science projects with the [Git](https://git-scm.com) ecosystem. [Git](https://git-scm.com) workflows open the door to advanced CI/CD tools (like [CML](https://cml.dev)), specialized patterns such as data registries, and other best practices.\n",
