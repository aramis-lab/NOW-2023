    "## What is data versioning ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Versioning is a technique to track changes made to data over time. It involves creating and storing different versions of data, allowing users to access and analyze specific versions whenever needed. Data Versioning ensures data consistency, traceability, and provides a historical record of changes made to datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traceability:** Track and understand the changes made to the data over time. This is crucial for compliance, auditing, and debugging purposes.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility:** By preserving previous versions of data, Data Versioning enables reproducibility of results. Users can analyze specific versions of the data used in previous analyses, ensuring consistency and accuracy of research and decision-making.\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** Data Versioning facilitates collaboration among data analysts and data scientists. Multiple users can work on the same dataset simultaneously, knowing they can easily access and switch between different versions without affecting others' work.\n",
    "- **Data Recovery:** In case of data corruption or accidental changes, Data Versioning provides a backup of previous versions, allowing businesses to recover and restore data to a specific point in time."

    "In the area of code versioning, there are a few tools available but Git clearly dominates the area. When it comes to data versioning, a relatively younger field, there are still a lot of available tools. We won't focus on enumerating them all here, but we will name the most popular ones and give some pointers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.com) replaces large files with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server.\n",
    "- [Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com) allows managing large files with git, without storing the file contents in git. It is a lower-level tool than [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) and [DVC](https://dvc.org) which expose higher level abstractions to users.\n",
    "- [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) which depends on [Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com). You can see it as a Python frontend to [Git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com). It provides a lot of useful abstractions to version datasets. The [DataLad handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/) is a great resource to learn how to use this tool.\n",
    "- [DVC](https://dvc.org)## Why DVC ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will rely on [DVC](https://dvc.org) rather than another tool from the list above. There are several reasons we made this choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Free and open source.\n",
    "- Easy to install: DVC is written in Python and can be easily installed in various ways.\n",
    "- The documentation is very good and easy to follow for newcommers.\n",
    "- The commands are **very** similar to the git commands. This means that anybody used to work with git will be able to work with DVC in no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These last points are particularly useful to enbark new contributors in a project relying on DVC for data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, you might be better using another tool. We strongly encourage you to take a closer look at them, especially [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) which occupies a similar place in the versioning tools ecosystem."

    "Data Version Control lets you capture the versions of your data and models in [Git](https://git-scm.com) commits, while storing them on-premises or in cloud storage. It also provides a mechanism to switch between these different data contents. The result is a single history for data, code, and ML models that you can traverse.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Lightweight:** [DVC](https://dvc.org) is a free, open-source command line tool that doesn't require databases, servers, or any other special services.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Projects stay readable with stable file names — they don't need to change because they represent variable data. No need for complicated paths like `data/20190922/labels_v7_final` or for constantly editing these in source code.\n",
    "- **Efficient data management:** Use a familiar and cost-effective storage solution for your data and models (e.g. SFTP, S3, HDFS, etc.) — free from [Git](https://git-scm.com) hosting constraints. [DVC](https://dvc.org) optimizes storing and transferring large files.\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** Easily distribute your project development and share its data internally and remotely, or reuse it in other places.\n",
    "- **Data compliance:** Review data modification attempts as [Git](https://git-scm.com) pull requests. Audit the project's immutable history to learn when datasets or models were approved, and why.\n",
    "- **GitOps:** Connect your data science projects with the [Git](https://git-scm.com) ecosystem. [Git](https://git-scm.com) workflows open the door to advanced CI/CD tools (like [CML](https://cml.dev)), specialized patterns such as data registries, and other best practices.\n",
